My work focuses on deriving the *position-dependent* extinction law of the
Galactic Center across  four near-infrared wavelengths -- 1.15um, 2.12um, 3.23um, and 4.05um.

This is done via the red clump (RC) method, [Wozniak & Stanek
(1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...460L..37S/abstract). 

Although theoretically this boils down to just measuring the linear slope of the red clump
cluster on a color magnitude diagram (CMD) and doing some neat math, it's a bit
more complicated than that.
